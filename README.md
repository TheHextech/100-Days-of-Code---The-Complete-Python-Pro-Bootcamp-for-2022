# 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022

This is a [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course taught by Dr. Angela Yu to learn how to develop in Python programming language. All along the course are proposed different challenges and project to do. It's a fantastic and progressive difficulty course! 

I'd like to organize all the course on Github too adding helpful notes and comments to the projects!
